# Tools in Data Science – IITM (Jan 2026)

GA & Project Writeups

This repository contains week-wise **steps, workflows, and solutions** for the Tools in Data Science course.

The course is challenge-based and tool-focused. There is no traditional content, so this repo helps you:

* Understand what each GA / Project is asking
* Know which tools to use
* Follow a clear step-by-step process
* See working commands and outputs

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each assignment/project has its own folder:

```
GA-1/        → Setup
GA-2/        → Deploy
GA-3/        → Source
GA-4/        → Wrangle
GA-5/        → Analyze
GA-6/        → Test
GA-7/        → Present
GA-8/        → Package
Project-1/
Project-2/
```

Inside each folder:

* Problem breakdown
* Tools required
* Step-by-step workflow
* Commands used
* Final output 

---

## 🧭 How to Use

1. Open the folder for your current GA or Project
2. Follow the steps in order
3. Run the commands yourself
4. Verify the output before submitting

LLM outputs can change, so always test locally. You can use LLMs to rephrase the solution according to your case.
